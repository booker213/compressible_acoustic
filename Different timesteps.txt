Stormer verlet vs Implicit mid point:

Implicit midpoint:

Exactly conserves discrete energy.

Involves matrix inversion and is the slower method.

Stormer Verlet:

Energy is not conserved.
Shadow energy conserved, with discrete energy bounded.

scheme is order 2, so energy bound should decrease by 4 if dt is halved.
